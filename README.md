# SVR Model for Power Consumption Evaluation

This repository contains a Support Vector Regression (SVR) implementation to evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics on a power consumption dataset.

## Before Running the Machine Learning Program

Before executing the machine learning program, you need to download the dataset in CSV format from the following Google Drive link.
